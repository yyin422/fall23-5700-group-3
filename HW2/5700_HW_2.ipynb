A slight difference between the Binance token and the coin market token is that the Binance token adds BUSD or USDT at the end, while the CoinMarket token does not. For example, Bitcoin is represented as BTC in CoinMarket and BTCBUSD or BTCUSDT in Binance. This represents the currency conversion to a stablecoin instead of a fiat currency.\n",
